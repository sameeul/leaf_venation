# leaf_venation
Code for fixing leaf modeling - 
There are 4 files.
CreateModel.py -uses the meshed blade part from Abaqus and predefined approximate venation structure to create a detailed venation structure using algorithm 1

RepairModel.py - uses the blade part and vein part generated by script CreateModel.py to repair in selected vein segments so that the resemble more realistic vein structure. The modified leaf part and vein part definition are saved as inp files

MergeModel.py -merges the two inp files containing the part definitions of blade and vein part into a single model. Then it sets up all the necessary task of model building such as material definition, constrains etc.

CreateInputFile.py - takes the inp file generated by MergeModel.py and take cares of the splitting of breached elements. Finally it creates the inp file used for analysis
